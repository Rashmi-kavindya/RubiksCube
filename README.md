Rubik's Cube Simulation

This project is a Rubik's Cube Simulation implemented in Java. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to manipulate and solve a virtual Rubik's Cube. The simulation allows users to rotate individual faces and layers of the cube in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Itâ€™s a fun and interactive way to practice solving the Rubik's Cube or experiment with its mechanics.
